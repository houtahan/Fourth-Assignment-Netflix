The assignment was to create a movie platform like Netflix and have users to access different features on this app.
The most important objectives were to learn about inheritance and polymorphism and try to use them in actual codes.
The approach was to have 5 classes for this code and code the menu in the main class.
In the TVShow class which is a parent class of the movie class we write the attributes of a TV show and in the Movie
class we write the attributes of a movie which has length attribute plus the TVShow attributes.
In the NetflixService class we code the functions related to the needs of the user and we complete them in the User class.
The most challenging part was to relate the classes and attributes in a correct way and it was done successfully through
searching and learning more about inheritance and polymorphism.
To make sure the code was complete and correct I ran it and made sure the arraylists were storing the correct variables.


The UML:
